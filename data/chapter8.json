          "definition": "AI alignment is a broad and critical field of research focused on ensuring that advanced AI systems act in accordance with human values and intentions. The \"alignment problem\" is that a model's trained \"objective\" (e.g., \"predict the next token\") may not perfectly align with the human's desired \"intent\" (e.g., \"be helpful, honest, and harmless\"). Techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are used to \"align\" the model's behavior more closely with human preferences.",

          "definition": "Guardrails are a set of rules, mechanisms, or policies implemented by a developer to constrain an LLM's behavior and ensure its outputs are safe and compliant. This can include \"allow lists\" of permitted topics or \"deny lists\" of forbidden ones. For example, a banking assistant might have guardrails that prevent it from giving financial advice. These rules are often implemented as a separate layer that filters the model's inputs or outputs, acting as a critical safety check on the model's behavior.",

These filters are applied to both the user's \"input\" (to prevent malicious prompts) and the LLM's \"output\" (to catch any undesirable content the model generates). These systems are trained on large datasets of harmful content (a process called \"red-teaming\") to learn to categorize and filter text related to hate speech, violence, and other unsafe topics.",

In a RAG system, this means the model is instructed to generate its answer only from the retrieved documents. The final output will often include explicit \"citations\" or \"provenance\" information, allowing the user to trace the answer back to its source. This builds user trust and dramatically reduces the risk of hallucinations.",

This vector is not just a random ID; it's learned during training to capture the semantic meaning and context of the data. Words with similar meanings or that are used in similar contexts will have embeddings that are \"close\" to each other in this high-dimensional vector space. This space can capture complex semantic relationships, famously illustrated by the vector equation King - Man + Woman ≈ Queen. This concept is what allows LLMs to understand nuanced relationships between words, and it's the core technology behind semantic search, where you can search by meaning (e.g., \"fruits that are yellow\") rather than just keywords.",

The most common metric for this is \"cosine similarity,\" which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in that high-dimensional space. This metric effectively measures their direction, not their magnitude. A cosine similarity score of 1 means the vectors (and thus the text) point in the exact same direction (semantically identical). A score of 0 means they are orthogonal or \"unrelated,\" and a score of -1 means they are diametrically opposed (semantically opposite).",

This is especially useful for integrating LLM outputs directly into applications and databases. By requesting structured output (e.g., \"respond with valid JSON containing fields: stem, a, b, c, d, correct_answer\"), you reduce ambiguity, make parsing reliable, enable validation against a schema, and significantly reduce hallucinations since the model is constrained by the expected structure. Many modern LLM APIs now have native support for structured output, automatically enforcing the schema.",
