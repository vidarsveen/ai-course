          "definition": "\"Vibe coding\" is a slang term for a more informal, exploratory, and \"natural-language\" style of development, often used when building quick \"prototypes\" with LLMs. Instead of writing precise, formal logic, the developer might \"vibe out\" a prompt (e.g., \"Just get the main ideas from this text and list them out, make it casual\"). While this approach is fast for experimentation, \"vibe\" prompts often lack the \"guardrails\" and robustness needed for a production system.",

Developers often use Claude for complex tasks beyond simple completion, such as refactoring large blocks of code, generating comprehensive test suites, or even \"repo-wide reasoning\" where the model is given context from many different files to answer a question or implement a new feature.",

It was a descendant of GPT-3 that was specifically fine-tuned on a massive corpus of public code from GitHub. While Codex itself has largely been succeeded by newer, more capable GPT models, its release marked the beginning of the \"code-gen\" lineage, proving that LLMs could be highly effective at understanding and writing software.",

          "definition": "There is an important distinction between two approaches: \"Using AI for coding\" means using AI tools as your primary development assistant (e.g., asking Claude or Copilot to write entire functions or classes for you). \"Using AI within coding\" means integrating AI capabilities as a feature within your application (e.g., building an app that uses Claude API to provide AI-powered features to your users). In this course, we focus on the first approach—leveraging AI assistants in your development workflow to write, debug, and improve your own code.",

Instead of typing prompts, you can speak your requirements naturally: \"Add error handling to this function\" or \"Refactor this code to be more efficient.\" You can also record yourself explaining what you want, and the voice-to-text capability converts your spoken words into text that the AI understands. This hands-free approach is especially useful when you're multitasking, sketching out ideas verbally, or prefer natural speech over typing.",
